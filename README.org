* Directed Diffusion
This is the official code for our Directed Diffusion research. Please visit our
project page ([[https://hohonu-vicml.github.io/DirectedDiffusion.Page/][DD.Page]]) for a quick introduction, or our paper for more
information in detail ([[https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13153][link]])

NOTE: This repository is associated with our ArXiv version v1 ([[https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13153v1][link]]). We will sync our work here in the near future with online demos.

* Usage
Please refer to our [[file:doc/walk-through.org][walk-through.org]] for more information from scratch. Once you
get familiar with it, then you could reproduce our paper result and alter some
of the parameter in [[file:doc/paper-result.org][paper-result.org]]. We also provide some of the experiments
that are not listed in our paper for fun [[file:doc/other-prompt.org][other-prompt.org]]!


* Update
| 28/Sep/2023: We have updated the latest version of our ArXiv paper. More validations, more ablations, with enhanced methodologies.
| 16/Mar/2023: Gradio Web UI integrated! See [[file:doc/walk-through.org][walk-through.org]] for more info.
| 01/Mar/2023: First release codebase

* Todo
| 28/Sep/2023: TODO: The latest v3 ArXiv work will be updated here.
| 01/May/2023: DONE: We will release our second version of DD to make our results more robust.
| 01/Apr/2023: TODO: We will update DD with latest diffusers version (v0.14.0) Currently we use diffusers v0.5.1
