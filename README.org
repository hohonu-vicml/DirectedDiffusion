* Directed Diffusion
This is the official code for our Directed Diffusion research. Please visit our
project page ([[https://hohonu-vicml.github.io/DirectedDiffusion.Page/][DD.Page]]) for a quick introduction, or our paper for more
information in detail (TODO:Arxiv Link)

* Usage
Please refer to our [[file:doc/walk-through.org][walk-through.org]] for more information from scratch. Once you
get familiar with it, then you could reproduce our paper result and alter some
of the parameter in [[file:doc/paper-result.org][paper-result.org]]. We also provide some of the experiments
that are not listed in our paper for fun [[file:doc/other-prompt.org][other-prompt.org]]!
